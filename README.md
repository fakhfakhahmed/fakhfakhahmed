## 👋 Hi there, I'm Ahmed Fakhfakh  
aka the bug whisperer, commit poet, and part-time frontend firefighter.

🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Developer | DevOps Dabbler | Coffee-fueled Code Conjurer  
Graduated engineer, but still learning things my compiler didn’t warn me about.

🧱 By day, I’m building scalable systems with React, Node, and Spring Boot.  
By night, I’m either refactoring code I swore was “fine” yesterday or explaining to Jenkins why the pipeline broke (again).

✨ Highlights of my coding saga:
- Turned monoliths into microservices without crying (much)  
- Built web + mobile apps that didn’t crash on launch (🎉)  
- Optimized APIs so fast they now answer before the question is asked  
- Lured Docker and Jenkins into actually cooperating on CI/CD  
- Dipped into AI with tools that make my code and my Git commits smarter (still waiting for AI that explains legacy code though)

💬 Fluent in:
- JavaScript, Java, PHP, Dart — and sarcasm  
- console.log therapy  
- Explaining to non-tech people that yes, dark mode *is* essential

🧰 Tools of choice:
🎨 Frontend: React.js ⚛️, Angular 🅰️, Flutter 🦋  
🔧 Backend: Spring Boot 🌱, Node.js 🟢  
📡 DevOps: Docker 🐳, Jenkins 🤖, SonarQube 🐛🔍  
🧠 AI/ML: OpenAI API 🤯, TensorFlow 🤖, OpenCV 👁️  
🗃️ Databases: MongoDB 🍃, MySQL 🐬  
⚒️ Extras: REST APIs, Microservices, Git wizardry, CI/CD spells

🌍 Tunisoise by origin, developer by obsession.  
When I’m not writing code, I’m probably:  
🎮 Raging at multiplayer lag  
🔥 Debugging IRL around a campfire  
🎬 Quoting movies like they’re API docs
