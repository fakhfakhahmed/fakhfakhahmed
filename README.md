### 🧑‍💻 Full-Stack Developer | DevOps Dabbler | Code Conjurer

Graduated engineer, still learning things my compiler didn’t warn me about.

### 🔥 What I Do

🧱 By day: Building scalable systems with React, Node, and Spring Boot.  
🌙 By night: Refactoring code I swore was "fine" yesterday, and negotiating with Jenkins.

### ✨ My Coding Saga

- 🧩 Turned monoliths into microservices (without losing my sanity — mostly)
- 📱 Built web and mobile apps that *didn't* crash on launch 🎉
- 🚀 Optimized APIs that now respond faster than your internet
- 🤖 Dabbled in AI tools like OpenAI API, TensorFlow, and OpenCV — because why not make the code smarter than me?

### 🌍 Based in

🇹🇳 Tunisia – Home sweet home, where the Wi-Fi is fast and the bugs are faster.

### 🎮 When Not Coding...

- Gaming in multiplayer lobbies (and blaming lag)  
- Camping far from runtime errors  
- Watching movies like I’m preparing for a film podcast  
- Explaining dark mode to people like it’s a life philosophy
